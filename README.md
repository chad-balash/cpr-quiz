This is a simple CPR quiz to test your knowledge on basic life saving skills. I created this using html, css, javascript, jquery, and bootstrap.

## Instructions

You will be asked a series of questions and given 20 seconds to answer each. You will be notified after each question whether you answered correctly or incorrectly, and then given a total at the end with suggested next steps.
